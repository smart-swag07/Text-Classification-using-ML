# Text-Classification-using-ML
This project uses machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes and SVM to classify text into categories such as news topics. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and model evaluation. Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, it offers a scalable solution for real-world text classification tasks.
